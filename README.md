# Peak Community Service

Since there aren’t any great community service scripts available, and the ones that do exist are either too simple or cost $20, I decided to create one for free. Enjoy! If you find any issues, feel free to open an issue in Github or join our Discord.

## Features
- The script randomly assigns tasks with custom locations, animations, and durations. Players can track their progress easily through a UI.
- Admins can assign tasks to both online and offline players, manage active services, update task counts, and release players when needed. 
- Supports ox_inventory confiscation, so if a player has items confiscated during service, they’ll get them back once they’re done. 
- Everything is fully configurable - task locations, permissions, penalties, logging, and more.
- Minimalist, responsive UI with real-time progress updates.
